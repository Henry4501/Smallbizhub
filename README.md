### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Imagine you've a favourite pani puri place for instance. And you only like it from a specific vendor. And now imagine, that the vendor just disappeared from their usual location. Sad right? But don't be...because we've come up with a solution specifically for that!
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

# Diagrams
Brainstorming ideas -> Creating a rough design in mind -> implementing the designing work in Figma -> Developing a webpage -> Result
First we'all discussed about the possible daily life problem statements. Then after choosing a topic, we tried to elaborate it and tried to incorporate it in a more meaningful way. Then we moved onto the designing work and the coding part. While 2 of us designed together, the remaining person developed a webpage parallely. Then we put it all together to get the final product.
